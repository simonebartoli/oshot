    message: "“It has been over 2 months since I had the O-shot procedure performed by Dr Wakil. I have been very happy with the results of the procedure. It has made a significant difference to both my level, speed and frequency of sexual arousal to the extent that I feel aroused on most days and at several intervals throughout the day. More specifically it has improved both lubrication as well as the duration and intensity of my sexual arousal. Physically, I can feel that it has increased the number of sensitive zones in my vagina. The area between the clitorus and introitus has become significantly more sensitive as has the introitus itself. The size of the clitorus also feels to have increased. Additionally, I have been able to experience vaginal orgasm which I hadn’t achieved previously. Obviously I was a little apprehensive prior to arriving at the clinic and was unsure of what to expect and how I would feel. However, upon arrival my fears were quickly allayed and my experience throughout was very positive. I was greeted by Dr Wakil’s secretary in a very kind and easy manner. The informal atmosphere and warm manner of both Dr Wakil and his secretary quickly put me at ease. The facilities at and products available in the clinic were state-of-the-art. Dr Wakil is excited by and dedicated to his groundbreaking work. He challenges himself to be at the cutting edge of his profession which enables him to provide the highest standard of medical care to his patients. He is committed to the development of his field and pioneering work which means his patients receive the most up to date and effective treatments available. He is a thoroughly charming, talented and dynamic man.”"

    message: "“I don’t know what I was worried about. The actual procedure took only five minutes (aside from the prep), and although I was expecting to feel pain and discomfort, in actual fact it felt like a gentle pinch, which surprised me because it was in a very sensitive part of the body. I didn’t feel any different but on the way home while I was on the train I experienced a terrible sneezing fit and couldn’t believe that I was still dry down below, and in fact I hadn’t embarrassed myself on a very busy train, as that definitely\n" +
              "would have been the case before the O-Shot®. The next day I decided to go to the gym and for the first time in years I was able to do a full workout including a 20 minute run on the treadmill. I felt totally confident that I wasn’t going to have an accident. I will definitely be back to my zumba class. This weekend I am really looking forward to being able to go out and not have to excuse myself 20 times to go to the ladies and to be able to laugh in confidence again. Dr Sherif has really changed my life and there is no doubt about that, and if you are considering the O-Shot® be prepared to have control over your life again. It has been a very liberating experience. Also to my surprise three weeks after the O-Shot®, I experienced a sexual arousal, to the effect I would not normally have. I was pleased as I wasn’t expecting that to happen – it was an extra bonus to the treatment. I really wasn’t expecting that, it was a good because it made me feel more like a woman again.”"

    message: "“It is nearly 2 weeks since my O Shot procedure, for the first week I had bruising visible, but that has cleared and the skin is now healthy and pink. I have only looked a few times but each time I do I see further improvements. My whole vulva is plumper and the inner lips which had almost disappeared due to Lichen Sclerosus have now come back. The pains that I was getting all through each day as a constant reminder of the disease have reduced by at least 80 – 90%. I am absolutely delighted with the results so far and am so relieved that there is treatment out there for me should it get bad again. To have an illness with very little treatment available was so upsetting before.\n" +
              "Thanks very much again Dr Sherif, the relief you can provide to ladies with Lichen Sclerosus is amazing.”"
