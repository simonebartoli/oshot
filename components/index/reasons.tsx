                    It’s not just men who experience sexual problems, such as decreased pleasure and sensation, but many women choose to suffer in silence! No longer does this need to be the case! There are plenty of causes for such problems; childbirth, menopause, even natural ageing; but there is just one solution: The O-Shot ®.

                        The O-Shot ® (or Orgasm Shot ®) is a new procedure developed to solve your sexual problems, increase your pleasure, and rejuvenate your vagina. It is a nonsurgical technique that uses the growth factors each woman has in her own body to stimulate vaginal and clitoral rejuvenation to activate the Female Orgasm System. Thus far, almost all women receiving O-Shot ® procedure enjoy an increased sexual response, and for many the improvement is dramatic. The O-Shot ® is also effective in improving and treating conditions such as urinary incontinence.

                        Our studies show that when platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is injected, stem cells multiply and grow new younger tissue. The O-Shot ® procedure works by using PRP to stimulate stem cells to grow healthier vaginal tissue. The whole procedure for processing the blood and injecting the growth factors takes less than 45 minutes- you could even fit an appointment at our Harley Street Clinic into your lunch break!
